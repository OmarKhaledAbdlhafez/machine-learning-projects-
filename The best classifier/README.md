# Classification with Python
### In this notebook we try to practice all the classification algorithms that we learned in IBM Maschine Learning  course.

We load a dataset using Pandas library, and apply the following algorithms :

- K Nearest Neighbor(KNN)
- Decision Tree
- Support Vector Machine
- Logistic Regression

 Then use the test set to report the accuracy of the model You should use the following algorithm:
